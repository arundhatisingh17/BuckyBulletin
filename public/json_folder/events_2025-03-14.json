Her research focuses on designing and evaluating AI technologies that promote language and literacy development, STEM learning, and wellbeing for children and families.Abstract: In this talk, I will focus on the role and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on children’s cognitive and social development. Drawing on my research in partnership with public media sectors, I will discuss how children interact with, perceive, and learn from AI, as well as their trust in their \"AI companions.\"  I will also discuss emerging directions regarding whether generative AI tools influence curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. I hope to engage with the audience to explore how the research community can amplify our collective voice and establish a stronger presence to ensure that AI is developed and implemented in ways that are safe and beneficial for children.",
