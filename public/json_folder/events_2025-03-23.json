King's work explores light through the manipulation of translucency and color. Through intentional positioning of poured silicone sheets, King creates large scale color fields with tones inspired by the sky. Light activates each work, which in turn generate subtle auras and change the atmospheric conditions of their surroundings and is transformative.",

Both poetic and practical, the exhibition explores what these treasures can teach us if we pay attention to their stories.",
