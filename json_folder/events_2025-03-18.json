King's work explores light through the manipulation of translucency and color. Through intentional positioning of poured silicone sheets, King creates large scale color fields with tones inspired by the sky. Light activates each work, which in turn generate subtle auras and change the atmospheric conditions of their surroundings and is transformative.",
